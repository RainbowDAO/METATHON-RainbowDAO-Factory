# Submission for the METATHON


### Project name

RainbowDAO  Factory :a multi-chain DAO infrastructure service protocol

### Team Name

Rainbowcity Foundation

### Submission links

We have submitted two versions of the smart contract  in this METATHON competition.
Solidity version on EVM and Ink! version on WASM.

The Solidity version is mainly deployed on Ethereum, BSC, Poygon, Near, Avalanche, Fantom, and various L2 networks; the Ink! version is mainly deployed on the parallel chains on the Polkadot and Kusama relay chains, as well as other blockchains developed with the substrate framework. 

However, due to the large workload of the entire development, there are still some differences between the content of this submission and the complete protocol. We will build the full version of the protocol in the next two months.

## Short pitch



  - Solution: 

RainbowDAO Factory is developed under the authorization of the Rainbowcity  Foundation, focusing on the creation of web3 basic component. RainbowDAO Factory belongs to a multi-chain infrastructure service protocol. 

Anyone can create and manage their own DAO organization through RainbowDAO Factory, including independent DAO,alliance DAO, parent DAO and child DAO. Any DAO can also create a management department within the DAO to achieve multi-level management of the organization.

At the same time, the RainbowDAO Factory is a set of multi-chain protocols that can be deployed on multiple different blockchains. It is convenient for DAO organizations on different chains to deploy their own DAO organizations through the Rainbow DAO Factory. At the same time, we will build a cross-chain protocol rainbow bridge in the future. Link DAO organizations on different chains through the Rainbow Bridge protocol to truly realize the cross-chain management of DAO organizations.

There are two versions of RainbowDAO Factory, Solidity version on EVM and Ink! version on WASM.

The Solidity version is mainly deployed on Ethereum, BSC, Poygon, Near, Avalanche, Fantom, and various L2 networks; the Ink! version is mainly deployed on the parallel chains on the Polkadot and Kusama relay chains, as well as other blockchains developed with the substrate framework.

  - Pain: 



![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RainbowDAO/Gitcoin/main/pic/4.png)

⑴ Single product function

At present, many  DAO tool products generally have the characteristics of single function, and they are far from being able to achieve some complex collaborative work. We hope to achieve some relatively complex collaborative work through the establishment of a series of DAO tools.

⑵. Low expansibility

At present, many DAO tool products generally have the characteristics of low expansibility, and cannot achieve function iteration and upgrade, which directly restricts the development of DAO organizations.

⑶.Low compatibility

At present, many DAO tool products generally  have the characteristics of low compatibility. There is no unified api interface or unified development document between each other, which can not be effectively compatible, and even more can not realize the role of collaborative governance.

⑷.Low diversity

At present, many DAO tool products generally have the characteristics of low diversity. Most products can only meet some general functions, and cannot meet the diversified and differentiated needs of the DAO organization.

⑸.Low operability

At present, many DAO tool products  generally have the characteristics of low operability. Especially for some novice users, the user experience is generally poor, and it is even more difficult to use these DAO tools.

⑹.Poor innovation

At present, many DAO tool products  generally have the characteristics of poor innovation. Most of them are learning from each other, the functional models are similar, and they have not essentially solved some of the pain points that are common in the DAO  industry.
